This plugin allows you to embed related forms in a Doctrine form class,
manipulate those embedded forms (i.e. add more, remove some, etc), and see
those relations updated when the form is processed.

    [php]
    class AuthorForm extends BaseAuthorForm
    {
      public function configure()
      {
        $this->embedDynamicRelation('Books as books');
      }
    }

Limitations
-----------

 * The primary key of the related model must by "id"
 * The embedded form class must include an "id" field

Roadmap
-------

 * Detect the related model's primary key
